A simple sudoku-app made in React. I want to use this project as means to practice my knowledge of Redux, as well as gain some exposure to typescript. I can be the first to admit that my redux understanding is not where i want it to be, and with typescript becoming more and more popular, I can kill two birds with one stone by making this app.

Starting the project. I expect quite a steep learning curve, as I've never had the chance to use typescript before, and it feels like this is a great opportunity to do so.

Done a lot of reading on TypeScript, begginning to understand it rather than just knowing what it is and how it works.

Will continue on the app tomorrow.
